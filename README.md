- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bbonillasnchz. Nice to connect with you over here!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development, Image Processing, and Data Analysis. In my free time, I enjoy writing small common reusable pieces of code that can make it easier for others to build things faster!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to write Mobile Applications. It's been really fun so far!
- ðŸ“« Send me an email! I'd love to hear about any cool ideas and I'm always happy to help out in any way I can.

Have a lovely day!
